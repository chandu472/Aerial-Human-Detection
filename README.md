Developing an AI model using YOLOv8 to detect humans in aerial drone images for Industrial Surveillance and potential Rescue Operations applications.

**Abstract**
Unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) equipped with high-resolution cameras and powerful GPUs 
have the potential to enhance Search-and-Rescue (SAR) operations in remote and hostile 
environments. Rapidly locating unconscious or injured victims is crucial for improving their 
chances of survival. This paper focuses on using drones as flying computer vision systems to 
increase detection rates and reduce rescue time. We conducted an experimental evaluation 
using the YOLOv5,Yolov7,Yolov8 algorithms, a lightweight version of the YOLO detection 
algorithm, on two newly created benchmark datasets specifically designed for SAR with 
drones. The results demonstrate promising outcomes, showcasing competitive detection 
accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art approaches but with significantly faster detection 
times.

**Problem Statement**
We have been given problem statement of Identifying and detecting humans in aerial view 
images captured by drones and UAV’s. Aerial images particularly of terrains , grass fields 
etc.So we need to develop model such it should be able to identify and detect humans.
In rescue and surveillance operations, the ability to detect and locate humans accurately and 
efficiently in large-scale environments is of paramount importance. Traditional ground-based 
approaches often face limitations in terms of coverage, accessibility, and real-time response. 
Therefore, there is a growing need for robust and effective human detection systems that 
leverage aerial images obtained from platforms such as drones or satellites.
However, detecting humans in aerial images poses unique challenges. Aerial images exhibit 
variations in scale, perspective, occlusion, and lighting conditions, making it difficult to apply 
conventional computer vision techniques designed for ground-level images. Furthermore, the 
presence of cluttered backgrounds, diverse poses, and the small size of humans in the images 
further exacerbate the complexity of the task.

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system for human detection 
using aerial image datasets, specifically focusing on aerial images obtained from platforms 
such as drones or satellites. The primary goal is to enable the detection of humans in real-time 
or near real-time, with a high level of accuracy and reliability. This system will be specifically 
designed for applications in rescue and surveillance operations, where the identification and 
tracking of humans in large-scale environments are crucial for effective decision-making and 
resource allocation.
So, our main objective is to develop a model to used in drone systems such that it should detect 
the human’s movements, actions. We use this technology in Industrial surveillances , to 
identify any movements of humans or animals over the Industrial Space.
